# MonsterHunterMaze 
Essentially, you are a hunter who catches monsters by laying traps. Using recursion, this program will help you determine
the best locations to lay traps as they can only be set in certain areas.

This program will ask for a text-file map (input) and then will read the file, determine where to set a trap and ultimately output it to a
solution file ("solution.txt")
Some key elements about the map is that the maze is always a square. 
The N represents the monsters nest.
The F represents the monsters food source. 
The P represents a potential trap site.

In addition, this program can also set the minimum number of traps to guarantee the monster's capture (Level 4). It can also determine how 
longit will take to capture the monster. That is, the worst case scenario if the monster heads from N to F. This is measured by the number 
of steps the monster takes until capture (Level 4+). Lastly, it can determine how long it will take to lay down all the traps. That is, 
the numbers of steps you will have to take to travel to all the other traps once you have laid down your first trap.
